# WordCounter <br>

The output file name is a new text file. It contains all the words in the first file followed by number of times each word occurred in the document. <br>
Finally, it shows total number of words in the document. <br>
The program is modified so that you must run it from a terminal with the following syntax: <br>
> java wordCounter InputFileName.txt OutputFileName.txt <br> <br>

The output file should be similar to bigResults.txt which is the result of counting the words in big.txt <br>
Note: the data structure used in this program is array list. Which won't be practical when the input file is huge. <br>
